# Daily Prompt script for Art Prompts
ðŸ’¡ A utility tool to post prompts from the Art Prompts Twitter accounts to the Discord community servers.

The tool uses the Twitter API and a Discord Webhook to post the recent tweet from the [Art Prompts](https://twitter.com/DailyArtPrompts) Twitter account (or the [NSFW account](https://twitter.com/artprompts_nsfw)), extract the drawing prompt, and post it to the appropriate Discord channel.

For the main prompts, it uses the query `Draw (#artprompts) (from:DailyArtPrompts)`, for the NSFW prompts, the query is `Draw (#artprompts) (from:artprompts_nsfw)`.

The code is public for transparency and cannot be properly used without the un-commited configuration files.
